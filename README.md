# ImpLib SDK

<img src="https://implib.sourceforge.io/logo.png" align="left" hspace="8" vspace="8" alt="ImpLib SDK"/>ImpLib SDK combines free programming tools for authoring custom import libraries Windows DLL. The SDK supports advanced features, like *cdecl2stdcall* conversion, importing by ordinal, removing *original thunk*, accessing internal undocumented functions. There are many non-standard use cases, like interfacing a DLL with *cdecl* calling convention from Visual Basic 6, prototyping a set of DLL functions for PureBasic, mangling the symbolic aliases for an existing 
object file in Visual C / MASM32 / NASM and so on. ImpLib SDK provides a set of tools to solve this kind of problems. It is not necessary to know the internal structure of an Import Library file to use these tools.

The ImpLib SDK is also useful to overcome any legal restrictions when redistributing the import libraries for certain DLL files, like the MicrosoftÂ® C++ runtime. The [import libraries for the CRT or STL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/crt-library-features?view=msvc-160) are part of the Windows SDK. Even though the SDK is available for free, redistributing these files is not allowed according to the current license agreements. An alternative is to generate these import libraries using the ImpLib SDK, as it doesn't restrict redistribution.

The [ImpLib SDK Guide](https://implib.sourceforge.io/EN.HTM) provides a more detailed description and a set of tutorials.

The ImpLib SDK is free even for commercial use and redistribution of any kind, as long as all copyrights are preserved. The whole package is provided "AS IS". Check the license file included in the current release for additional info.

## Installation and Usage

Unpack the ImpLib SDK release into any directory. Then launch the ```build_libs.bat```. This batch file builds or rebuilds all the sample import libraries. The building process may take several minutes to complete due to the large size of the sample libraries.

The output libraries are stored into the ```lib``` subdirectory. Two import libraries are created for each input file: a regular import library including *original thunk* and a stripped version without *original thunk*. The latter is stored into ```lib\stripped```.

If you add new import library definitions or modify the sample files, just rerun ```build_libs.bat```. Only new or moified files will be recompiled.
